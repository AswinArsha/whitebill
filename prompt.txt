   - **Employee Requests for Adjustments**: Provide a way for employees to request adjustments to their attendance (e.g., if they forgot to check in), subject to admin approval.

### 14. **Automated Attendance Reminders**
   - **Check-In/Check-Out Reminders**: Automatically send reminders to employees to check in or out if they haven't done so within a set time after the start/end of the workday.
